# SBOM Essentials

Several use cases exist around SBOMs. In the following these are further detailed.

## Creating an SBOM

An SBOM represents knowledge and insights on one or more Software Assets. 
Such information can be either gathered manually or applying tools producing 
SBOMs based in different inputs.

Tools may be specifically used in continuous integration environment to anticipate
changes in the underlying Software Assets and produce correlating SBOMs.

When creating an SBOM it is of relevance for what purpose the SBOM is 
produced. Depending on the downstream use cases different sets of information are
required.

### Software Representations

Software has many representations. When referring to Software either the **source 
code**, the **binary** or the **distribution** representation is meant.

It is essential for downstream use cases what **software representation is of 
interest**.
